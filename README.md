# wsstress
I made this to do load testing for WebSocket service for one of my customer. ws-client.js is the one who does the job. But you need to find a way to run multiple instances of it.<br>
1. install nodejs and WebSocket libs<br>
2. Depending on your OS (Linux or Windows):<br>
use runme.bat/test.bat as or runme.sh/test.sh<br />
4. Execute runme.bat/sh
